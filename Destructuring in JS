What is Destructuring?
->The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible
to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.  
->It is diff from Spread.
Spread takes out all the elements from the array or object and puts them into another array
or object where Spread is being used.
Whreas, Destrcuturing allows to pull out single values from the array/object and assign it 
to a variable
EG: 
//ARRAY DESTRUCTURING:
let a, b, rest;
[a, b] = [10, 20];

console.log(a);
// expected output: 10

console.log(b);
// expected output: 20

[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

console.log(rest);
// expected output: Array [30,40,50]

//OBJECT DESTRUCTURING:
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c:3 };
const { a, b } = obj;  
// is equivalent to:
// const a = obj.a;
// const b = obj.b;
console.log(a); //op: 1 
console.log(b); //op:2
console.log(c); //op:undefined, coz we have not pulled out the 'c' property from the object
